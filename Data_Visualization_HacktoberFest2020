In this problem i have used data visualization for understanding the data in much more efficient way.

->I have used Inbuilt python modules and packages for creating several graphs such as:
>> Histograms
>> Bargraphs
>> Pie-Chart
>> Area-Plot


-> Data visualization important Because of the way the human brain processes information, using charts or graphs to visualize large amounts of complex data is
easier than poring over spreadsheets or reports. Data visualization is a quick, easy way to convey concepts in a universal manner â€“ and you can
experiment with different scenarios by making slight adjustments.

-> Data visualization can also:
>> Identify areas that need attention or improvement.
>> Clarify which factors influence customer behavior.
>> Help you understand which products to place where.
>> Predict sales volumes.
